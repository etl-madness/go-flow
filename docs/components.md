# Template entity

The `<template>` element renders Go text templates using the current pipeline variables. It can read the template from an external file or from inline XML content, and it can optionally store the rendered output in a variable.

| Attribute / field | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier for the template node. This is the logical name used in execution results and diagnostics. |
| `name` | No | Friendly name for the template when it is parsed by Go's template engine. If omitted, the engine still works with a default internal name. |
| `file` | No | Path to an external template file. If provided, the file contents are used as the template source. This is optional when the template is provided inline. |
| `engine` | No | Declares the template engine. In the current implementation, execution uses Go `text/template`; this attribute is accepted for compatibility and documentation purposes. |
| `output_var` | No | Name of the pipeline variable that receives the rendered output. This is the primary output variable name. |
| `var` | No | Alias for `output_var`. If `output_var` is not set, this value is used instead. |
| `mode` | No | Output behavior for the result. `summary` returns a brief success message; any other value (including unset) returns the rendered template text itself. |
| `content` | Conditional | Inline template body text located between the opening and closing `<template>` tags. This is required when `file` is not set. |

Notes:
- `file` and inline `content` are mutually exclusive sources for the template body.
- The template is rendered with the current registry variables available in the pipeline.
- If both `output_var` and `var` are empty, the rendered text is still generated but not stored into a named variable. 

# SQL entity

The `<sql>` element executes a SQL statement against a configured database connection. The statement can be supplied inline or read from a pipeline variable.

| Attribute / field | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `db` | Yes | Name of the configured database connection on which to execute the SQL statement. |
| `database` | No | Alias for `db`. |
| `var` | No | Name of a pipeline variable that supplies the SQL statement. When its value is non-empty, it takes precedence over inline content. |
| `variable` | No | Alias for `var`. |
| `output_var` | No | Name of the pipeline variable that receives the query output. |
| `out_var` | No | Alias for `output_var`. |
| `output_variable` | No | Alias for `output_var`. |
| `content` | Conditional | SQL statement placed between the opening and closing `<sql>` tags. Required when `var` or `variable` does not resolve to a non-empty SQL statement. |

Notes:
- SQL output is always stored in `LAST_OUTPUT`; specify an output attribute to also store it under a named variable.
- Use either `db` or `database`, and use either inline `content` or a non-empty `var` / `variable` SQL source.

# SQL bulk entity

The `<sql_bulk>` element streams the rows returned by a source SQL query into a destination table.

| `variable` | No | Alias for `var`. |
| `output_var` | No | Name of the pipeline variable that receives the number of rows copied. |
| `out_var` | No | Alias for `output_var`. |

| `keep_nulls` | No | Whether explicit `NULL` values are preserved during SQL Server bulk insert. Defaults to `false`. |
| `content` | Conditional | Source SQL query placed between the opening and closing `<sql_bulk>` tags. Required when `var` or `variable` does not resolve to a non-empty SQL query. |

Notes:
- `target_table` is required because bulk SQL streams query results rather than returning them as a result set.
- The number of copied rows is always stored in `LAST_OUTPUT`; specify an output attribute to also store it under a named variable.

# Assert entity

The `<assert>` element checks whether a pipeline variable meets an expected condition and can halt the pipeline, continue with a warning, set a failure variable, or run fallback nodes when the check fails.

| `operator` | No | Declares a comparison operator. This attribute is accepted by the configuration model; assertion evaluation uses the variable and expected-value condition supported by Flow. |
| `message` | No | Custom message included in the assertion result when the check fails. A default message is generated when omitted. |
| `on_failure` | No | Failure action. `halt` (the default) stops the pipeline; `warn` and `continue` record a warning and allow it to continue. Any unrecognized value also halts the pipeline. |
| `fail_var` | No | Name of a pipeline variable set when the assertion fails. |
| `fail_val` | No | Value assigned to `fail_var` on failure. Defaults to `true` when omitted. |
| `on_failure` child element | No | Nested pipeline nodes to execute only when the assertion fails, such as cleanup or notification steps. |

Notes:
- `var` is mandatory; use `equals` or `value` to define an equality expectation.
- Failure child nodes execute before the `on_failure` action determines whether the pipeline stops or continues.
